# 2D Personalized Fighting Game

## Project Overview
This is a 2D personalized fighting game developed using Python and Pygame. It serves as a learning project focused on:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
- Character physics implementation
- Asset management techniques
- Core game development principles

The project reflects my initial steps into game programming, inspired by:
• YouTube tutorials
• Udemy courses
• Pygame documentation

---

## Development Approach
Instead of using complex game engines, I chose Pygame to:

- Better understand fundamental game programming concepts
- Gain hands-on experience with:
  - Character physics
  - Asset handling
  - Game logic management
- Build a strong foundation before advancing to engines

---

## Key Features

### Core Systems
- Object-Oriented Design: Modular architecture using OOP principles

### Character Physics:
- Movement mechanics (walking, jumping)
- Attack collision detection

### Asset Management:
- Image and sound file organization
- Animation system

### Current Content
- Custom fighter character (personalized avatar)
- Inspired by potential Instagram client services

---

## Future Development Plans

### Short-Term Goals
- Complete graphical user interface (GUI)
- Enhance game interface visuals

### Long-Term Vision
- Implement multiplayer functionality
- Develop online battle features

---

## Learning Journey
This project has been an educational process where:

- Each challenge provided growth opportunities
- Mistakes became valuable lessons
- The experience solidified my passion for game development

---

## Technical Specifications

### Primary Technologies:
- Python (game logic and scripting)
- Pygame (graphics, sound, and core mechanics)
